This is a Python script to make life within a multi-OS work environment less annoying. It directly converts the file paths inside an Adobe Premiere project file from a Windows path to a Mac path (or vice-versa), bypassing Premiere's built-in relinking process.

WARNING: I made this script for my own use, so it hasn't been tested on other systems, and it likely isn't bug-free. Use at your own risk, and make a backup of your project file before anything else. I'm not responsible for any loss of data.
